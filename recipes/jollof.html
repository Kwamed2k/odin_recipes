        <h3>The best jollof in town</h3>
        Jollof is a delicious meal made from rice and tomato stew and it's consumed
        by almost people around the world and it's most enjoyed by Africans.
        As a Ghanaian, I personally prefer
        jollof to other Ghanaian meals.
        
        <p>This meal also enjoyed by Nigerians the most and its recipe raises
            "a-kitchen-banter" between Ghana and Nigeria sometimes.Though I 
            like this meal its recipe is another thing that causes some people a bit.</p>

                <li>Combine tomato, red bell pepper, chili and water in a blender for the sauce.
                    Blend on high until smooth and set aside.</li>
                <li>Heat cooking oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and salt and
                    sauté until onion starts to soften, 4 to 5 minutes. Clear space in the
                    middle of the pan, add tomato paste, and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes.
                    Season with paprika, ginger and pepper; continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes
                    until everything is well combined.</li>
                <li>Turn off the heat and stir in the rice, making sure every grain of rice is
                    coated with the oil-tomato mixture. Add bay leaf and chicken bouillon paste.</li>
                <li>Turn heat to high, stir in tomato sauce, and bring to a vigorous simmer.
                    Cover with a tight fitting lid, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for
                    20 minutes. Do not remove the lid or stir rice.</li>
                <li>Turn off heat after 20 minutes, and set the timer for 12 minutes.
                    Allow rice to sit and do not remove the lid.</li>
                <li>After the 12 minutes are up, remove lid, and fluff rice with a fork,
                    separating all the grains. Serve garnished with green onions and chopped
                    cilantro.</li>
