        <h3>The best peanut soup in town</h3>
        Groundnut soup is a popular kind of Ghanaian soup made from, as the name reveals,
        groundnuts. Depending on where in the world you are, you may either call them
        groundnuts or peanuts. Groundnut soup is deeply comforting and can be made with
        a variety of proteins. 
        
        <p>In this recipe, I use chicken to make this mouth-watering
        and slightly spicy, satisfying soup. It can however be also made solely with beef,
        or more commonly with a mix of fish, crabs, and meat. This soup can be eaten with
        boiled ripe plantains, boiled plain rice, boiled yam, fufu, kenkey, kokonte, or gari.</p>
