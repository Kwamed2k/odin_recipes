        <h3>The best pizza in town</h3>
        Pizza is a palatable meal/snack which is basically made from flour dough and
        consumed by almost people around the world but also serves as a staple food in
        Europe (precisely Italy).
        
        <p>Originating from the ancient flatbread traditions of the Mediterranean,
            the modern form of pizza was developed in Naples, Italy, becoming a
            cheap meal for the working class before gaining royal recognition and
            international popularity through Italian immigration and global travel.</p>
